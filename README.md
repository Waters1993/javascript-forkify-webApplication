## Motivation & Acknowledgements

This project was created while completing "The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## Work Vs. Template Code

HTML elements and CSS styling were provided as a template file for this landing page.<br>
I added JavaScript to add dynamic and interactive content to the page such as a sticky nav bar, a tabbed component, and a slider component. I utilized the intersection observer API to add smooth transitions to each section. Performance considerations included lazy loading images and efficient script loading.<br>

## JavaScript concepts and techniques used

- Event Propagation: Bubbling and Capturing
- Interstion Observer API
- Lazy loading images
- Smooth scroll
- Building tabed and slider components

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- VS Code
- Git
